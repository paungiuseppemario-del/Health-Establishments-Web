# Requirements

## User Needs

### Actors
Actors would use this with booking appointments, checking for opening times, checking nearests farmacies. 
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.
. patients
. Doctors
. Pharmasists
. Nurses

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit). 
Patients would use this to be able to find appointments, closest pharmacies, gps etc.
Doctors/nurses would use this to manage and see appointments they are booked in for, patient medical history.
Pharmasists would use this to manage someones medication, find local pharmacies for patients if they dont have stock of a certain medication, check patients medical history for allergies or previous medication taken.
### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

| USE-CASE | UC1: Find nearest public bike pump | 
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Description** | As a cyclist I want to find my nearest public bike pump. |
| **Actors** | cyclist |
| **Assumptions** | Browser supports geo-location |
| **Steps** | <ol><li>Opt to view table of bike pumps</li><li>Request permission to access user location</li><li>Give permission for geo-location</li><li>Get nearest public bike pumps from database</li><li>View table of nearest bike pumps</li></ol> |
| **Variations** | Browser doesn't support geo-location |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |


| TODO: USE-CASE ID e.g. UC1, UC2, ... | TODO: USE-CASE NAME | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |


TODO: Your Use-Case diagram should include all use-cases.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
    e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
    
* FR1: The system must provide a menu of available options (from UC1)
* FR2: The system must request permission to access user location (from UC1)
* FR3: The system must get the user location from the geolocation object (from UC1)
* FR4: The system must get nearest public bike pumps from database (from UC1)
* FR5: The system must show a table of the nearest bike pumps (from UC1)
* FR6: The system could request a post-code from the user to determine their location (from UC1)

<dl><dt>FR1:</dt><dd>The system shall provide a menu of available options</dd>
    <dt>FR2:</dt><dd>The system shall request permission to access user location</dd>
    <dt>FR3:</dt><dd>The system shall get nearest public bike pumps from database</dd>
    <dt>FR4:</dt><dd>The system shall show a table of the nearest bike pumps</dd>
</dl>


### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
Give each non-functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. NFR1, NFR2, ...

Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.

* NFR1: It should display up to 10 of the nearest bike pumps on one page (usability) (UC1)
* NFR2: It must assume a sensible default on a browser with no user geolocation (reliability) (UC2)
* NFR3: The listed bike pumps should be no further than 1 mile from the cyclist (usability) (UC1,UC2)
* NFR4: The App should work on Android (Portability)
